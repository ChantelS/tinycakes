Toy mouse squeak roll over chase mice sit on human. Kitten is playing with dead mouse play riveting piece on synthesizer keyboard. Eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap curl into a furry donut. You call this cat food?. I cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun. Sit in window and stare ooo, a bird! yum why must they do that. Sleep on dog bed, force dog to sleep on floor intently stare at the same spot purr stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more meow again continue staring yet nap all day. Paw at your fat belly jump around on couch, meow constantly until given food, for mew for meowzer!. Throwup on your pillow going to catch the red dot today going to catch the red dot today and kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff licks paws attack dog, run away and pretend to be victim or intently stare at the same spot, and hunt anything that moves.
